Licensing Information

BNET style / website?

Please carefully review the licensing terms for *all* of the embedded libraries, including transitive dependencies (!). You can find them in the source code or in the git submodules and their respective directory trees. Although I've tried to only include software that's compatible, it's possible that I missed something or that my interpretation of the licensing terms isn't entirely correct.
